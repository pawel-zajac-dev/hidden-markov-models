# Hidden-Markov-Models

- **SEO and Bounce Rate Optimization**  
  Applying Markov models to analyze user navigation behavior on websites. Helps estimate bounce probabilities and optimize user flow: `sites.ipynb`.

- **2nd-Order Language Model**  
  Building and training a second-order Markov model to generate realistic phrases. Demonstrates how state memory enhances text generation: `whitman.ipynb` .

- **Google’s PageRank Algorithm**  
  Implementation of the classic PageRank algorithm using Markov chains to rank webpages based on link structure: `pagerank_algorithm.py` .
